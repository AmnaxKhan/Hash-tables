The goal of this programming assignment is to get a better understanding of implementing hash tables with separate chaining as well as how to optimize hash table to reduce the collisions. A text file containing information about the names, countries, cities, genders, and GPAs of students was read into the program and stored in the hash table. The program outputted a menu to the user and allowed the user to input the number that corresponds to the menu choice they would like to execute. Based on this information, the users were either allowed to input more data or the program output information to the user. Error handling was implemented so that the user did not perform actions that the program could not allow. For example, a default statement was included in the switch case to ensure that the user could only choose 1-6 for their menu option.
